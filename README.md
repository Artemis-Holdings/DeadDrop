# ðŸ’€ Dead Drop



Dead Drop provides ye faithful an encrypted messaging and file sharing platform. Should thine secrets become paraded or scorned, ney a soul shall know what is in thine heart lest they too know the Drop Identification Number and password.

Harken unto Dead Drop, the noble solution for the secure exchange of messages, veiled in a shroud of anonymity. Dead Drop hath been meticulously crafted to afford thee a sanctified channel for discourse, ensuring the privy nature of thy missives remains unassailable. Be it the dissemination of delicate knowledge, clandestine parlance, or merely a reverence for thine own seclusion, Dead Drop doth pledge its guardianship.


# ðŸª¶ Useage

Here, no denizens of users abide; instead, Dead Drops emerge as enigmatic specters, public yet shrouded in encryption.

Thusly, Dead Drop hath woven a sanctuary of mystical encryption to ensure thine anonymity and message sanctity. Messages are encased within enchanted cryptographic alchemy, using post-quantum encryption algorithms; safeguarding both content and essence. 

The sanctum safeguards thy identity and holds no chronicles of the ethereal correspondence. Dead Drops, public yet encrypted, bear the enigma of DIN and Password only. Even if obtained by the wrong hands, tracing back to the originator remains forever obscured.

## Transmission of Missives

To commune through the mystic veil, adhere to these precepts:
- From the sanctum's threshold, intone `n` upon the main sigil, invoking a new Dead Drop.
- With ink from thine heart, etch a title onto the parchment of your Dead Drop, giving it form and purpose.
- Inscribe your arcane secrets with care, as they shall journey through the astral currents.
- Utter the incantation of passwords, twice spoken, to erect the guardians of your missive's sanctum.
- At this juncture, an option shall be unveiled, offering to bind an ethereal attachment to your conjuring. Elect to grant it protection, and a portal shall open, allowing you to select your attachment. Take heed, however, for the realm imposes its limits on the size of these artifacts.
- When your Dead Drop stands ready, invoke `s` to submit your sacred message, imparting it to the Ã¦ther's embrace.
- Thou shall be bestowed with a Drop Identification Number (DIN); hold it close to thy heart, for it shall be the key to unveil thy message in times yet to come. Nor shall you recover the DIN should it become lost or forgotten.

## Receipt and Modification of Missives
The ritual to peruse or amend a message mirrors the art of crafting anew:
- Choose `V` for View or `E` for Edit.
- Bestow the designated DIN upon the portal.
- Utter the secret password.
- There, before thee, shall the message be revealed or malleable, ready to be surveyed or shaped as need arises.
